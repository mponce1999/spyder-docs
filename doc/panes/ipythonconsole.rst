# ID5: 85923 (please change to last 5 digits of your student id)
# Email: MICHAEL.PONCE3@baruchmail.cuny.edu (please change to your email)
# File: main.py 
# Purpose: Python program that prints: Hello, World!

# Notes: 
# 1. Lines that begin with the hashtag sign (#) are comments and not executed.
#    Such lines are for informational purpose only and not part of the main
#    program. The program will still execute in the absence of these comment
#    lines.
# 2. The first comment regarding "utf-8" notifies some code editors, such as 
#    Spyder, that the file uses utf-8 character encoding. Generally, this is
#    of no concern to us for this class, but if you use non-English characters 
#    in your programs, you might have to use an appropriate encoding. 
# 3. Change my email to your own one, File to the name of the program file (if
#    different from main.py), and Purpose to state a very brief description 
#    of the purpose of this program. Please make sure to be consistent with the 
#    punctuation and put a ": " (colon and single space). Being consistent is a 
#    good practice.
# 4. For every assignment, please use your Baruch (or CUNY) email in the Email 
#    field comment above. If you forget to add this, I will deduct 0.5 points.
# 5. This program prints the message Hello, World! on the screen. For 
#    your first assignment, you will change it to print the last 5
# 6. When you edit this file, you may safely remove the comment lines: 7-26.
